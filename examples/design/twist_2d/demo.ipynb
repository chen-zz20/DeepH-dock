    "## Getting Started with the Terminal Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the terminal command-line tool to generate twisted 2D heterostructures. The tool provides a straightforward interface with configurable parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Command\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dock design twist-2d stack -h\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Usage: dock design twist-2d stack [OPTIONS] PRIM_POSCAR1 SUPER1_A1_A2 PRIM_POSCAR2 SUPER2_A1_A2\n",
    "\n",
    "  Generate twisted 2D heterostructures with custom parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Options:\n",
    "  -d, --next-layer-dis FLOAT  Distance between twisted layers (in Angstrom).  [default: 2.0]\n",
    "  -z, --start-z FLOAT         Starting z-coordinate for the first layer.  [default: 0.1]\n",
    "  -h, --help                  Show this message and exit.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage\n",
    "Generate a twisted bilayer structure with carbon and boron nitride layers:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dock design twist-2d stack \"POSCAR-C\" \"7,8,-8,15\" \"POSCAR-BN\" \"8,7,-7,15\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced Usage: Python Class API\n",
    "\n",

    "## DeepH-dock: Flexible Integration for Computational Research\n",
    "\n",
    "DeepH-dock is designed with developer convenience in mind, offering multiple integration points:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dual Interface Design\n",
    "- **Command-Line Interface**: Perfect for quick prototyping, batch processing, and integration with shell scripts\n",
    "- **Python API**: Ideal for complex workflows, custom analysis pipelines, and integration with other computational tools\n",
    "\n",
    "### Seamless Integration\n",
    "The library follows Pythonic design principles, making it easy to incorporate into existing projects. Whether you're building automated workflows with tools like `Snakemake` or `Nextflow`, or developing interactive notebooks with `Jupyter`, DeepH-dock provides a consistent and intuitive interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extensibility\n",
    "The modular architecture allows researchers to:\n",
    "- Extend existing functionality with custom transformations\n",
    "- Implement new structure generation algorithms\n",
    "- Integrate with popular computational chemistry packages\n",
    "- Build custom visualization and analysis tools\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quick Reference\n",
    "| Use Case | Recommended Approach | Key Benefits |\n",
    "|----------|---------------------|--------------|\n",
    "| Quick structure generation | Terminal command | Fast, one-line solution |\n",
    "| Batch processing multiple structures | Shell script + CLI | Easy automation |\n",
    "| Custom workflow integration | Python API | Full program control |\n",
    "| Research & development | Python API + Jupyter | Interactive exploration |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Development Philosophy\n",
    "DeepH-dock embraces the Unix philosophy of \"doing one thing well\" while providing multiple access points. This design ensures that both novice users and experienced developers can work efficiently with the tool (See \"For Developers\" Section).\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by experimenting with the terminal commands for quick results, then explore the Python API as your needs grow more complex. The consistent parameter naming between interfaces makes transitioning between them intuitive and straightforward."
