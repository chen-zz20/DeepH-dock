  #  Suggested "tight" defaults for Te atom (to be pasted into control.in file)
  #
  #  2020/09/15 Added g function to "tight" settings, since this creates truly "tight"
  #             but not overly tight defaults. See "intermediate" settings for the past
  #             "tight" settings, which are still very reliable. Consider "intermediate"

  within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -5.91113050 eV
  | Occupation number:      1.33333333

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at     4.85694473 eV
  | Occupation number:      0.00000000

  This system has fractional occupation numbers. Thus, it is a degenerate system
  within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).
  Overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.00000000 eV.

  | Chemical Potential                          :    -5.88067348 eV
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

          or bugs. https://aims-git.rz-berlin.mpg.de is also the main development site
          of the project and all new and updated code versions can be obtained there.

  #  Suggested "tight" defaults for Te atom (to be pasted into control.in file)
  #
  #  2020/09/15 Added g function to "tight" settings, since this creates truly "tight"
  #             but not overly tight defaults. See "intermediate" settings for the past
  #             "tight" settings, which are still very reliable. Consider "intermediate"

  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  This system has fractional occupation numbers. Thus, it is a degenerate system
  within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).

  #  Suggested "tight" defaults for Te atom (to be pasted into control.in file)
  #
  #  2020/09/15 Added g function to "tight" settings, since this creates truly "tight"
  #             but not overly tight defaults. See "intermediate" settings for the past
  #             "tight" settings, which are still very reliable. Consider "intermediate"

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -5.91113050 eV
  | Occupation number:      1.33333333

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at     4.85694473 eV
  | Occupation number:      0.00000000

  This system has fractional occupation numbers. Thus, it is a degenerate system
  within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).
  Overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.00000000 eV.

  | Chemical Potential                          :    -5.88067348 eV
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  #  Suggested "tight" defaults for Te atom (to be pasted into control.in file)
  #
  #  2020/09/15 Added g function to "tight" settings, since this creates truly "tight"
  #             but not overly tight defaults. See "intermediate" settings for the past
  #             "tight" settings, which are still very reliable. Consider "intermediate"
  #             for hybrid functionals, for example.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -5.91113050 eV
  | Occupation number:      1.33333333

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at     4.85694473 eV
  | Occupation number:      0.00000000

  This system has fractional occupation numbers. Thus, it is a degenerate system
  within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).
  Overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.00000000 eV.

  | Chemical Potential                          :    -5.88067348 eV
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.
